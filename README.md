# C++ Practice ‚Äì WSL & GitHub Playground

This repository is for **practice purposes only**.

I'm using it to:

- practice writing C++ programs,
- improve my skills using the Linux terminal via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux),
- and get more comfortable with Git and GitHub workflows.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

Each `.cpp` file in this repository is a small, self-contained exercise covering topics like:

- basic functions (`swap.cpp`)
- finding values (`findValue.cpp`, `findMax.cpp`)
- sorting arrays (`sortArrays.cpp`)
- and more

The corresponding `.o` and `.out` files are compiled versions for testing.

## üéØ Goal

The main goal of this repository is to improve my skills in:

- C++ programming
- using the Linux command line (WSL)
- version control with Git and GitHub

Feel free to explore the files ‚Äî feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
